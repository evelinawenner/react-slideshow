# React-slider

This is a image slideshow built in React with Typescript, using images from Unsplash API.

## Potential additions

Many slideshows use dots to display where in the list of images you are currently located.

Alterations to the get-functionality if the slideshow would contain more images.

Some fun styling and animations.

## Run the app

### `npm start`
